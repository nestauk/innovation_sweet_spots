# # Intro to basic network analysis
#
# **In this notebook**
# - Building a collaboration network between research organisations working on a technology
#     - Nodes = organisations, links = a common project
# - Visualising the network that allows exploration of the relationships by a non-data scientist
#
# **Some potential further directions**
#
# Using Gateway to Research data:
# 1. Interactivity
#     - Using Altair to explore the network, allowing to check organisations and what projects form the basis of the links
#     - Exploring displaying these networks in [kumu](https://kumu.io/), which is used by the ASF team
# 2. Performing simple analyses and highlighting:
#     - Which organisations are most the central ones? (i.e., most interconnected, hinting at their importance)
#     - How different types of organisations (universities, businesses, local authorities) are placed in the network, how central they are?
#     - Perhaps: Communities or connected components of organisations. Maybe a nearest-neighbour subgraph (involving all direct neighbours) is interesting to highlight
#     - Also: Can we explain the results (e.g. why a particular organisation might appear very central?)
# 3. More advanced analysis: Characterising network growth over years
#     - Visualising the new links across years
#     - Can we say something about a 'growth mechanism' ? (e.g. does it look like preferential attachment, i.e. rich get richer, or more like random growth)
#
# **Would also be very interesting to use Crunchbase data to visualise the network of investors and businesses**
