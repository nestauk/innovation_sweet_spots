       "  'body': '<p>The UK is lagging far behind France and other EU countries in installing heat pumps, research has shown, with less than a tenth of the number of installations despite having similar markets.</p> <p>Only 55,000 heat pumps were sold in the UK last year, compared with more than 620,000 in France. Twenty other European countries also had higher installation rates than the UK.</p> <p>Heat pumps, which are powered by electricity and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/mar/11/heat-pump-revolution-what-you-need-to-know\">work rather like fridges in reverse</a>, are considered the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/12/heat-pumps-uk-householders-ditching-gas-central-heating\">most efficient way for the UK to shift to low-carbon heating</a> and away from the gas-fired boilers that heat the majority of homes. With gas prices still at high levels, heat pumps are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/30/heat-pumps-more-than-80-per-cent-of-households-in-great-britain-satisfied-with-system\">cheaper to run than gas boilers</a>, though more expensive to install, and could be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/sep/07/heat-pumps-should-be-key-to-trusss-energy-strategy-urges-expert\">cheaper still with further changes to the electricity market</a>.</p> <p>At current rates, the UK has little chance of meeting the government’s target of 600,000 heat pump installations a year by 2028. However, according to analysts from the MCS Charitable Foundation, which approves low-carbon certification standards, gearing up to do so could create 50,000 new jobs, up from only about 2,000 jobs in the industry today.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/may/30/heat-pumps-more-than-80-per-cent-of-households-in-great-britain-satisfied-with-system\">Heat pumps: more than 80% of households in Great Britain ‘satisfied with system’</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The MCS report, titled Heat Pump Rollout in France and the UK 2023, called on the government to make heat pumps mandatory for all new homes, scale up and extend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2022/jan/14/fund-home-insulation-and-heat-pumps-for-people-on-low-incomes-pm-urged\">grants to install heat pumps in existing homes</a>, introduce new loan schemes for homeowners, and embark on a countrywide awareness campaign to explain heat pumps and the incentives on offer.</p> <p>The existing <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/feb/22/450m-boiler-upgrade-scheme-failing-deliver-heating#:~:text=The%20scheme%20has%20been%20allocated,meet%20its%20net%20zero%20goals.\">boiler upgrade scheme</a> must be extended to be effective, the report said, and ministers must bring in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/mar/21/new-homes-gas-boilers-hydrogen-heat-pumps-net-zero\">long-awaited future homes standard from 2025</a>, with a clear end-date for the sales of gas boilers.</p> <p>David Cowdrey, the director of external affairs at MCS, said: “Heat pumps are an extremely efficient technology for cutting carbon and bills, but the UK has so far not capitalised on their potential. With other countries such as France surging ahead, the race is on for the UK to step up. We need a much more comprehensive set of policy measures to meet the government’s targets.”</p> <p>The UK’s market for heat pumps grew by about 40% in 2022, but from a very low base, with only 1.9 heat pumps installed for every 1,000 households last year, compared with 20 for every 1,000 households in France, and nearly 70 in Finland.</p> <p>MCS said it was not too late for the government to meet its targets, pointing to an 80% increase in France from 90,000 installations in 2018 to 175,0000 in 2019 after the introduction of a grant scheme available to all households.</p> <p>Jan Rosenow, the director of European programmes at the Regulatory Assistance Project thinktank, said: “Leading heat pump markets around the world have one thing in common: a stable and clear policy and regulatory landscape. If the policy package is right, consumer demand and industry investment follows, as experience from other countries shows very clearly. The UK can be a global leader on clean heating but this requires long-term policies to drive consumer demand and supply chain expansion.”</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said: “We’re investing billions to improve energy efficiency across the country, with over £70m in vouchers issued to installers in the first year of our boiler upgrade scheme. We are fully confident of meeting our aim of 600,000 heat pump installations a year by 2028 – and consumers can now install one for an increasingly similar price to a gas boiler.”</p>'},\n",

          "the domestic renewable heat incentive, rhi, which householders can use to get subsidies for technologies such as biomass boilers and groundsource heat pumps, launched in 2014 and is currently due to expire in 2017.",
          "for instance, ground source heat pumps are difficult to install, biomass heating can produce soot particles, and biofuels made from plants are controversial as they can contribute to deforestation if not closely managed.",
          "the heat pump industry argues that the relatively higher tariffs for biomass introduced in the rhi caused the heat pump market share to collapse by more than half.",
          "the move was sparked by comments from the department of energy and climate change's minister of state, charles hendry, who recently said he was closely reviewing the 27bn renewable heat incentive, rhi, scheme due to start in april next year to encourage the take up of green heating devices such as heat pumps, and the 8bn feed in tariff, fit, launched in april which pays small scale generators of green electricity.",
          "decc's own future of heating publication shows hardly any biomass by 2030, with super efficient heat pumps, currently a little more expensive than biomass boilers, becoming the dominant heating technology by mid century.",

          "martin mc. guinness, the deputy first minister, has called on foster to step aside amid an investigation into the scheme, which offered financial incentives to farms, businesses and other non domestic consumers to use biomass boilers that mostly burned wood pellets, as well as solar thermal and heat pumps.",

          "under the renewable heat incentive, rhi, homeowners will be paid for energy generated by solar thermal panels, biomass boilers and heat pumps that they install in their homes at their own cost.",
          "financial incentives for householders will also be available for low carbon technologies such as solar panels, biomass boilers and ground source heat pumps, paid for by a levy on utility companies.",
          "the controversial report could affect the government's plans to launch its renewable heat incentive, rhi, next april to pay householders for generating heat from such green ground and air source heat pumps.",
