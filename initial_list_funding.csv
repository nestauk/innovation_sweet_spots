Children,VoxiKids,https://voxikids.com/,parenting_tech_proj,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/voxikids,0,Ilfov,Bucurestii Noi,61210.0,"We’re bringing a SaaS platform & a mobile app to the e-health market, to enhance child’s language recovery.","VoxiKids transform speech therapy processes by moving them into the digital market. We’re bringing a SaaS platform to the e-health market, offering a selection of high-value materials designed by speech pathologists, as well as management tools that streamline the collaboration between parent and therapist, with the common goal of assisting the child’s recovery and integrating them into the pre-school and school environments. Mission: VoxiKids digitalizes the speech therapy process in order to positively impact children with speech impairments and reduce recovery time, thus helping them better integrate into their social environment and school community. We can achieve this by bringing both parents and therapists together for the benefit of the child’s development. The problem: The e-health market is now in full expansion, with opportunities arising at a global level. Traditional speech therapy requires a dedicated space, work materials, and a qualified speech pathologist. But in a world caught in the fray of digitalization, where recent events have put even more pressure on us to digitalize as many processes as possible, we’ve also noticed a change in the way that speech therapy sessions can be carried out. Across the world, 34 million children are in need of access to speech therapy, and over half a million of them are in Romania. The real problem is that speech therapy practices are few and far between. There are countries where a parent must wait up to 24 months to gain access to therapy. The solution & its advantages: VoxiKids offers a complete multilingual platform for online speech therapy, which integrates specialized exercises created by speech pathologists, and the means to manage and track the progress of each child enrolled in therapy. Specially designed for language development therapies, it is thus helpful for speech pathologists, parents, and implicitly, children. In its final version, the SaaS platform includes 20 modules that cover: online therapy, content (such as exercises, homework, statistical data), administration (for instance billing, the handling of specific documents, patient management), communication (appointments calendar, relevant notes), patient management (tracking progress, adjusting therapies, appraisals, reports). Knowing that learning through play is an efficient method that can be integrated into the recovery process; the content and statistics present in the SaaS platform were also aggregated in the mobile app (for iOS and Android) in the form of interactive games so that children can continue practicing at any time and anywhere. VoxiKids respects the HIPAA and GDPR standards, being a trustworthy solution. Our main advantage is timing – we can be the first in a niche that will very soon be in focus for very large US/Israel players (and not only). The current context, which has given a boost to the e-health area, makes us even more attractive to end customers. Our product has the advantage of easy scaling in terms of software and content. Clients: Our beneficiaries are the parents, the children with speech deficiencies being the end-users. Our main clients are speech therapy offices, hospitals, and clinics. Business Model: VoxiKids mobile App (MVP), is based on 3 types of subscriptions. Upon download from the Apple or Google Play stores, it comes with 45 free exercises and an average subscription cost of 10 euro/ month, paid by the parent. The B2B subscription fee in the SaaS platform is based on the number of children added to the platform (between 2 and 5 euro per child/month) and the number of tools that the therapist requires access to – a speech therapy practice can thus have an average cost of 50 euro/month and can get up to 100 euro/month. Additional revenue may be generated via the dedicated marketplace, which will be added to the platform in September 2021. VoxiKids has demonstrated in just 1,6 years that an MVP model can be successful. We have over 10.000 downloads from Google Play alone and only on the Romanian market, and 4.000 active users/month. We estimate that, in 12 months, we will be able to generate an income of up to 60.000 euros/month, from the B2B segment. We are certain, however, that this potential will be strongly impacted by establishing the appropriate partnerships. Innovation – in order to enhance pronunciation, we will integrate an AI for speech, beginning with December 2020. With this module integrated into the mobile app, children can exercise their speech and pronunciation, helping them recover in a shorter time. Accessible digital platform: parents and speech therapists can easily navigate the application. VoxiKids has a friendly interface with a modern design and a UX that allows users to use it without having to acquire complex technical skills. Exit strategy: The growth of the e-health segment is more than obvious, especially in developed markets. Our exit strategy is based on product quality and on the fact that it will be difficult to replicate, thanks to the technologies incorporated within, as well as our coverage of a wide market in the next 5-6 years. Among key players that operate in this market and that may show interest in our product, we count Motion Computing Inc., Epocrates Inc., Telecare Corporation, Mediasafe, Set Point Medical, IBM, Doximity, Lift Labs, and Apple, to which we can also add private equity funds.",61210.0,2021-12-17 00:00:00,grant,0.13123032864467613,0.170549,3.111046,1,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/voxikids-grant--1a340d64,0.13123032864467613,2,0.24068309795947254,1,7.620189710167041

Our method is very simple – by activating KidED the application starts running on the background of kids' screen-time activities, after preset intervals KidED pauses ongoing activity, regardless of what it is, and overlays the screen with a quiz to be solved.   KidED is offering a huge value to parents who are in lack of time and struggling with their kids aged three to eight years stuck in the screen and not eager to learn. Most current educational applications need parental guidance or supervision in order for the kid to be engaged in the activity and as soon as they leave the kid unattended, one will most likely find more appealing activity - like playing a game.   Parents get to choose from a wide variety of subjects and will get to see on which subject their kid is doing well and on which they might need help with. The structure and content of KidED quizzes are worked out by the group of researchers of cognitive science and children's psychology from the University of Tartu which ensures reliable child’s development according to one’s age and level of knowledge.  With a screen-lock timer feature, KidED gives parents also an opportunity to regulate the length of kid’s screen-time per day. For KidED, it is important to help parents to raise smart and healthy kids.  For kids, we are offering a fun and rewarding learning experience through illustrations and gamification.  We're currently the only educational application on the market which targets to incorporate educational quizzes and tasks into kids' other activities on the device instead of hoping for the kid to stay in an educational application. It means the kid will receive these quizzes regardless of what he/she is doing (while the service is active) and parents don't have to stand by kids to make sure they are learning.

The idea for Zoodles was born while Mark watched his 4-year-old daughter, Abbie, struggle while using the computer. He wondered why kids were constantly trying to adapt to computers rather than having the computers adapt to them. After talking with dozens of other parents, it became clear that they were all equally frustrated with the experiences their children were having online.  While parents universally believed that the computer could help their kids learn, they just didn't have the time or resources to scour the web and find any of this fun, educational content themselves. Additionally, parents wanted more say over what their children were doing online. Without trusted content, they really didn't want to open up the whole, sometimes scary, web to their young kids.  Mark decided it was time to build a safe, fun, and educational online experience for kids that also gave parents the information and control they wanted. After discussing the idea with his friend, Rich, they decided to form a company to build Zoodles. â€¨  Since then, the team has grown to include incredibly talented engineers, educational experts, and creative designers who understand how to build simple interfaces for kids. The team is excited to be working on a product that can change how children learn while giving parents an active role in the experience.

Digitalisations seems to be the solution: more and more schools (37% in 2018) use tables, resulting in learning with little social interaction. While tablets are good for individual learning, it’s isolating children. Cooperative learning is the key. While making learning more fun, increasing self-confidence, motivation and ownership, teachers save time on preparation and repetitive support. Luqo does not have any manuals or tutorials for children, they need to discover it themselves while learning.  Creating more valuable one-on-one time with teacher and child, thus making sure that no child is left behind, and each child can grow to their full potential. While current cooperative learning solutions depend on teacher’s guidance, increasing their workload, Luqo makes it easy and accessible. Connect the four Luqo hit buttons to your own tablet and download the Luqo app. Place the tablet flat on the table, so the children can stand around in an instant social setting with their Luqo hit button, and you’re are good to go.  Luqo games are for pre-school until the age of 12, ranging in different topics like Language, Numeracy and Topography. Luqo games are based on the PIES theory of Kagan: each child has a specific role in the game, making them dependent on each other, while still being individually responsible of their own input. The roles rotate so there is no hierarchy, making them equal while they’re all playing and learning at the same time.

The firm invests in a number of highly promising startups and uses its programs to advance product development, acquire customers, and scale. SOSV companies consistently achieve funding led by top tier investors. SOSV joins seed, series A, and later rounds. As of January 2022, SOSV had more than 1,000 portfolio companies and $1.2 billion in assets under management, reflecting a 40% increase over 2020. Among the top companies in SOSV’s portfolio are NotCo, Perfect Day, Upside Foods, Yeelight, Opentrons, Shopal, Snapask, BitMEX, and API3.

SOSV’s latest program, dlab, fosters new players in blockchain. Founder Experience SOSV programs review applications from all over the world, and any pre-seed or seed-stage company is welcome to apply. SOSV provides $150,000 - $250,000 in exchange for equity, but certain biotech startups may receive as much as an additional $250,000 or more from the Genesis Consortium, a partnership between IndieBio and leading VCs and industry partners, including co-founding partner Mayfield. Founders spend 4-6 months in a formative cohort experience marked by coaching from on-staff experts (including alums), regular workshops led by mentors and guests, and access to technical resources, including engineers, labs, and other facilities. After a program’s completion, the SOSV partners continue working closely with founders to bring on lead investors for follow-on investment. Unlike most startup programs, SOSV continues to invest as a major syndicate participant—up to 20% of new rounds—in subsequent seed, series A, and later investments. In 2020, SOSV invested $46 million in post-program rounds; in total, SOSV portfolio companies in 2020 raised $1 billion. In June 2021, SOSV announced the close of the $100 million SOSV Select Fund, which is designed to invest in the series B and later rounds of its portfolio companies.

Background Managing Partner Sean O’Sullivan founded SOSV in 1995, following the IPO of MapInfo, a startup he co-founded that pioneered computer-based street mapping. O’Sullivan is deeply committed to social betterment through entrepreneurship and technology, a theme that runs deeply through the SOSV portfolio.

At the end of 2020, 34% of SOSV’s portfolio companies had at least one female founder.

We do this through a childcare service that matches children with one of our inspiring Role Models. We believe childcare is about much more than an after school pick up or babysitting. It’s about inspiring children to dream big, teaching them the mindset they need to thrive and be equally as passionate as they are about the things they love. Childcare to us is ensuring every child feels valued and supported, feels confident to make great choices and most importantly is having serious fun in the process.  Life Skills Courses  We have a programme of life skills courses developed by our education team that are designed to help children thrive. We focus on Leadership, Resilience, Creativity and Collaboration to ensure children can understand their own strengths and use them in a way that helps not only themselves but others.

Families connect via a mobile app to search, discover, and create local experiences to share with their young children. The Adventure Clubs free mobile app offers an opportunity for families with young children to easily create beautiful childhood memories. Forget about those cumbersome lists of what to do with kids in a particular city. Just because something exists doesn’t mean there will be any other families there when you go. And we all know, everything is more fun in a group.  Our kids need education, socialization and stimulation, and so do we. That’s why Adventure Clubs exists. This is your opportunity to handcraft the life that your child dreams of… One that’s full of adventure, experienced with the person they love most–you! Adventures are exciting planned experiences, created by other parents just like you, and brought to you via the Adventure Clubs mobile app. Adventures are created and led by Adventure Leaders and may happen any day of the week. On any given adventure, there are usually 3 - 12 families including moms or dads, and their children (ages 6 months - 10 years). Imagine, every day opening up your Adventure Clubs app and being able to easily find what’s happening near you and then going on adventures alongside other families with kids!  It’s flexible too. You just adventure whenever it works for you–with no minimum, no maximum, no commitment at all. It’s easy and fun for parents, and incredible for kids!  With the Adventure Clubs app, you can: • Browse local adventures your family will enjoy • Choose and RSVP to adventures you like • Create your own adventures to experience with others • Invite your family and friends to adventure with you • Message co-adventurers before and after your adventure You can create or explore exciting local adventures in these twelve categories:  • Animals • Creative • Education • Environment • Food • Museums & Culture • Music & Dance • Parks & Playgrounds • Sports & Fitness • Transportation • Water Play • Other Through this app, we have loads of incredible, kid-friendly, local, family-oriented adventure options offered to us at our finger tips. Adventuring is experiential learning at it’s finest, and learning through experience is how kids learn best.  If you’d like to be an Adventure Leader, all you need is a great idea and you can create one on your Adventure Clubs app. You can set the adventure to “public” if you want to open it up to meet new friends or set it to “private” and invite only your current friends to join your adventure. There are two different kinds of adventures with Adventure Clubs:  • Everyday Adventures  • Premium Adventures An Everyday Adventure is something simple and easy to plan such as bike riding at a local park, hiking through the forest, getting hot chocolates and playing puzzles at a coffee shop, or making sandcastles on the beach. Forget about “play dates”-adventuring is way more fun!  A Premium Adventure is an extra special adventure that is set up by the Adventure Clubs team with a local Adventure Host, (a local business or non-profit organization). A Premium Adventure might be a special behind-the-scenes tour of a famous theater, or a baking class with a pastry chef, or a meet-n-greet with professional performers or athletes, a tour of a private jet. Adventure Clubs is always coming up with incredible ideas for Premium Adventures.  The price for each Premium Adventure is different and all of the information will be in the adventure description in the app and the amount for the Premium Adventure is to be paid directly to the Adventure Host (place of business or non-profit organization). Premium Adventures are led by our top leaders, who are hand-picked and trained by Adventure Clubs.  So what are you waiting for?

The emphasis is on increasing student achievement in STEM  science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and literacy at the end of the school year a  college scholarship will be giving to One Student in America and one student in Nigeria.    We created Mitch School Box Club as a non-for-profit so that not only is it a one-stop shopping portal for your back-to-school supplies and educational enrichment supplies, but a means by which WE collectively can help those children who need most support.  It will be donated to a disadvantaged child in your community.   ​ Our Focus Mitch School Box Club Foundation tackles critical problems primarily affecting the United States and Nigeria Africa for the  poor and disadvantaged, and supports strong and effective partner organizations to do the same. We believe that good stewardship means maximizing our resources, including grant funding and staff time, while building strong partnerships based on trust.   Students When families can barely afford rent and groceries, school supplies just can’t be a priority. For these students struggling with extreme poverty, and to provide distressed communities and disadvantaged students we can offer school supplies. We serve kids at schools where at least 70% of students are enrolled in the federal free or reduced lunch program. We do this through our National Network of Resource Centers and our School Ready Supplies program.   Teachers On average, teachers spend $578 per year from their own pockets on school supplies for their classrooms. That’s why we offer 40 Resource Centers across the country where teachers can go to obtain free school supplies. We also offer Teacher Supply Boxes provide successful applicants with two boxes containing roughly $500 in the most essential school supplies — from notebooks and markers to pens and glue. ​ Education A solid foundation in education is key to success later in life. Your donations fund teachers, books and extracurricular activities to help get youngsters off to the right start. This will also help us support every School in America with a strong S.T.E.M Program in there school which will also help our overseas schools in Nigeria.

The BabyPlus:registered: Prenatal Education System is the only patented curriculum of its kind on the market today.    How BabyPlus:registered: Works:  BabyPlus:registered: introduces a safe, simple set of sounds to a child as early as 18 weeks in the womb.    These sounds are patterned after the mother’s heartbeat, the one language the baby can recognize at this very stage of life because it’s the only true and consistent sound of the prenatal environment.  The variation of sounds stimulates the baby’s cognitive development and as the child progresses through the BabyPlus:registered: curriculum, he or she learns to discriminate between those sounds.  In other words, auditory learning begins. Most importantly, it begins during a stage that will have the most enduring benefits for the child. The developmental benefits of BabyPlus truly last a lifetime.   The BabyPlus:registered: curriculum is made up of 16 lessons that can be started anytime between 18 and 32 weeks.  The prenatal education system is designed for the mother to wear twice a day; an hour in the morning and an hour in the evening, starting with lesson one and progressing through the lessons slowly over the course of the pregnancy.  This auditory exercise strengthens learning ability during the developmental period when the advantages will be most significant for a child.  Much like a prenatal vitamin encourages strong physical development, BabyPlus:registered: encourages strong cognitive development. BabyPlus:registered: - From Hollywood and Beyond:  BabyPlus:registered: is becoming a must-have pregnancy item for many celebrities. Gwen Stefani used BabyPlus:registered: while pregnant with her son, Kingston and she has recommended it to friends like Boris Kodjoe and his wife Nicole Ari Parker, who used it during their second pregnancy.  New mom Nicole Richie picked up her BabyPlus:registered: system at Destination Maternity and used it during her pregnancy with Harlow.  Nicole and father Joel Madden continuously report in the media a laid back, calm baby.  Melissa Joan Hart used the system during her pregnancy. The original Bachelorette Trista Sutter used BabyPlus:registered:, as well as actress and new mom Ali Landry, among many others BabyPlus:registered: Partners  BabyPlus:registered: is continually developing strong partnerships within the industry and reaching more expectant mothers around the world every day.

Our extension makes it super easy to capture your online learning for your professional growth! And now we are focused on building a 360 degree resume aka EnGrip knowledge profile of people that talk beyond their formal education.  We're super passionate about solving the biggest problems in education and talent management i.e. reducing and eventually eliminating the skills gap by promoting self-learning and empowering learners with a shareable and intuitive knowledge profile. Want to know more? Read further: What is EnGrip? You have got networking sites for showing off your social life and professional achievements. How about a profile that could validate your knowledge and skills? That’s Engrip. Essentially, it is an online application that powers your professional career growth with a shareable knowledge profile. With EnGrip, you can chronicle, organize, and showcase your online learning experiences in a reliable and effortless manner. Why did we create EnGrip? Our learning has changed. It has moved from the confines of a classroom to more organic experiences like reading, networking, participating; activities that traditionally haven’t fallen under the heading learning primarily because there is no technology available to track these learning. Thus organizations and individuals are losing this information. EnGrip aims to solve this challenge. We are building tools and technology to capture your learning wherever it happens. With EnGrip, all your learning counts not just the certificates from work and training courses. Do you think a 2-page resume tells everything about your knowledge? Certainly not! You are more than your resume and that is what you can prove with EnGrip. We believed that a record of users’ learning experiences can be a more informative version of their experience than a resume and publishing users’ learning experiences can help in identifying them as an expert in a particular field to be sought after for an advice, questions or even jobs. We call that a Living Resume. Gone were the days where you go to school to learn things. Now you can learn almost everything online. Use EnGrip to capture, organize your online self-learning experiences and create a profile that shows your true potential beyond your resume. Remember you are more than what your resume tells about you!",155126.0,2016-02-05 00:00:00,angel,0.027486163185145508,0.04,0.0,1,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/engrip-angel--88724cab,0.0,0,0.027486163185145508,0,0.0

Rejected,Easyclass.com,http://www.easyclass.com,parenting_tech_proj,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/easyclass-com,United Kingdom,England,London,121748.0,Easyclass is a non-profit organization offering FREE Learning Management System.,"Easyclass is a Learning Management System (LMS) that allows educators to create digital classes whereby they can store the course materials online; manage class discussions; give assignments, quizzes and exams; monitor due dates; grade results and provide students with feedback all in one place.  Easyclass allows teachers/professors and students to communicate, collaborate, share and learn in a private, secure and user-friendly platform.  HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER LMSs? Unfortunately, LMSs normally cannot be afforded by all schools and universities. However, with the introduction of web-based LMS, Easyclass.com; teachers, professors and students now can have access to all the digital tools they need for learning – and for FREE. Easyclass sets out to disrupt the LMS industry by creating an EASY TO USE, yet powerful software system that will be the new standard for open technology in education.   Different from the traditional LMS providers, Easyclass also has online discussion forums as part of its core features, which are instrumental in enhanced learning experience. Online discussions promote collaborative exploration and critical thinking and hence foster deeper understanding among students towards the subject matter.  Easyclass is also a social network for teachers and professors. Educators can create groups with their colleagues and can share educational content with each other and discuss about new trends.  We aim to democratize education among the learning community by giving FREE access to the platform.   WHAT IS THE REVENUE MODEL OF EASYCLASS? Our business model is very different from other LMS providers as our platform is completely free of charge. It boils down to the idea that a platform with millions of students and instructors is very valuable, because it could be leveraged for distributing content such as educational applications, videos and digital books. There are many possibilities for the future, but right now our focus is on building the platform and providing a great experience to our users.  WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES EASYCLASS A SECURE AND PRIVATE ENVIRONMENT? -Easyclass platform targets only educators and students.  -Digital classes on Easyclass.com are created and managed by the teachers/professors. -Teachers/Professors have full administrative rights on student participation in their class. o  Students need an access code to join the class. If a student shares the code outside the class, the teacher can change it, without affecting students who are already enrolled in the class. o  Teachers can delete posts and remove class members.  o  Teachers may choose to receive automatic notification of student postings into the class before they are published on class walls. o  Anonymous posting is not possible. -The content created within the digital classes can be viewed by the class members only as they are effectively closed groups.  -Private conversation between students is not possible. Students may only communicate to the whole class or the teacher, which reduces opportunities for cyber-bullying. -If a school upgrades (free feature to be launched soon) to the institutional features, the school admin can audit all teacher and student activity.  -Parental access to their children’s posts/grades and to the teacher is an optional feature, which is also to be launched soon.  -Easyclass does not have any advertisements. -Easyclass is hosted on Amazon Cloud / Ireland.  BENEFITS TO TEACHERS/PROFESSORS -It’s easy to learn and use: The interface works like Facebook but is even easier to use. Easyclass.com is not overloaded with complicated features and presents a user-friendly interface.  -Time saving. Imagine you have to grade 143 tests comprising 50 multiple choice questions each! Easyclass will do it for you.  -No more photocopying, carrying and grading stacks of paper and writing comments out. All of this can be done online for your assignments, tests and quizzes whenever wherever you are.  -Enhanced learning: In today's classrooms, there is often limited time to cover topics fully. When Easyclass is used as a learning platform, additional resources can be used to enhance learning. -Great platform for Blended Learning initiatives: If you are looking to incorporate more digital content in your curriculum and looking for a robust platform that is affordable (like, free!) then Easyclass may be a perfect fit. -Continuous professional development: Easyclass Groups provide a way for teachers to connect with like-minded educators to exchange ideas, get advice and share resources. -Ability to stay connected with students: From snow days, swine flu, extended absences or just attending to a conference, teachers are able to be connected with their students.  -Safe environment: With no advertisements and a process which gives full control to the teachers/professors for managing the classes, Easyclass addresses the fundamental concerns of privacy and safety. The content created within the digital classes can be viewed by the class members only!  -Digital citizenship: Easyclass provides teachers the opportunity to teach responsible interaction via digital means, reinforcing good digital citizenship among students. -Support: The support Easyclass team offers is amazing! We get back to any queries within 24 hours.    BENEFITS TO STUDENTS -The platform is so easy that lower elementary students can be taught to use it. -Online resources and materials stored in digital classes are at the fingertips of the users. -Easyclass allows students not only to learn from their teachers but also from other students.  -Online discussions promote collaborative exploration and critical thinking and hence foster deeper understanding among students towards the subject matter.  -When students interact with their teachers outside the class, their attitude towards the teachers changes dramatically in a positive way.  -Students build their skills of becoming independent and responsible by logging in to view and submit assignments and hence monitor progress. This is something they would normally experience in college and in their career. -Students can submit quizzes and see their results immediately (except for short answer questions). -Easyclass promotes student confidence. Some of the teachers on Easyclass say that one student who isn’t comfortable speaking up in the classroom is opening up online. -Using Easyclass gives students the feeling of using a social-networking site without having to mix their personal lives with their school lives. -Students enjoy the interaction Easyclass brings in the classroom on this 24/7 online environment.",121748.0,2013-09-01 00:00:00,angel,0.6430048677141921,1.0,0.0,0,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/easyclass-com-angel--34aa2fa8,0.0,0,0.6430048677141921,0,0.0

Nowhere can this trend be seen more clearly than through the example of Getting-in, an educational portal that caters for every conceivable area of life that secondary-level children, students and career-minded young people could need as they prepare themselves for their futures.   It has already enjoyed phenomenal success, building up a dedicated online following and experiencing an explosion in its readership base. This hasn’t just taken the form of visitors to the site, but also students getting involved through its social media presence, such as its Twitter feed, which keeps students updated with crucial information about areas such as open-day dates and other developments in the world of careers and education. In part the popularity of the site is down to the quality of the resources that it offers. Created by professional writers and careers and education experts, the quality of its advice articles and study resources is unparalleled. Students looking for advice on where to apply to university get insightful and practical advice from is Applying section, while GCSE and A-Level students have access to revision guides for all of the most popular secondary-level subjects that bring the curricula to life. Students can book on to open days all over the UK and courses.  However, what has really set Getting-in apart from other educational sites and made it such a hit with young people is that it pays every bit as much attention to the needs of young people who want to head into the world of work or training rather than continue with their studies, or people who have not yet made up their minds about such dilemmas. It offers a huge range of articles and guides on finding job opportunities, taking a gap year, exploring training options and even setting up a business. In an age where higher education carries a considerable financial burden, young people are looking more than they have done for several generations for equally rewarding opportunities, something that Getting-in seems to be one of the very first sites to recognize. Getting-in has also made itself popular through some highly innovative extra features, such as an extensive database of university and college profiles profiles. Also a calendar of open days with a booking system, and a wide selection of special offers for students at the UK’s most popular high-street stores and restaurants. With the momentum behind Getting-in looking to be unstoppable—the site has been receiving more and more visitors every single month since it was launched—not only is it proving that the future of education advice and resources lies online, but it is also leading the way in defining the possibilities of how the Internet can help young people best prepare for their futures in an ever-more competitive job market and an increasingly expensive educational world.",861706.0,2012-01-01 00:00:00,undisclosed,0.16,0.248293,0.0,0,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/getting-in-undisclosed--ebc0bcb7,0.0,0,0.16,0,0.0

And it’s this curiosity that helps kids actually learn while playing a hame.  The startup’s first title Dinorama, which is aimed at kids ages 7 through 12, is based around encouraging children to build a dinosaur theme park. The actual gaming and creative element centralizes around how to make the park successful from a financial standpoint.  In Dinorama, kids learn about earning, spending, and saving money by building amusements for their visitors, caring for their dinosaurs, and weathering events like rainstorms that increase maintenance costs and lower ticket sales.",162850.0,2013-04-17 00:00:00,series_unknown,0.984042958336507,1.5,0.0,1,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/recurious-series-unknown--e25f1ee7,0.0,0,0.984042958336507,0,0.0

Schoolze started as a simple messaging and newsletter scheduling web-app for a Pacific Grove preschool class in early 2015 with an objective to make parental communication and field trip photo sharing, private, secure and easy. The response we received from local parents and teachers was overwhelming, and the site witnessed 70%+ returning parents who visited the website every day. Intrigued by the engagement site generated, we went in researching the impact and found that for various reasons, our schools (and students) do not get enough parental involvement and that this lack of engagement is responsible for problems such as teen depression and high drop-out rates in high schools. Looking at the early traction, our founder, Avneesh Kumar quit his consulting director job and started building and scaling Schoolze full time with a mission to help schools increase parental engagement in a measurable way. He also initiated research in the classrooms to find key factors on how parental engagement leads to higher student achievement. In July 2015, Avneesh brought in his long-term colleague and friend Nirmal Kannan as a co-founder and technology head.  This turned out to be a crucial decision in the history of the company, as Nirmal transformed the platform into an engagement analytics platform and added much-needed fundraising options later. In building and scaling of Schoolze, we learned pretty early that almost every school needs funds to help students achieve more. This was what lead to critical insights which became paving stone for Schoolze becoming a fundraising platform. Today, Schoolze has proudly built technology which saves time for teachers, generates money for schools & education institutions, and provides actionable parental engagement insights to school and district administrators. Schoolze is currently working on linking the parental engagement to student achievement in the area of early childhood reading and writing and also aspires to make a parental advocacy product in 2017.",508379.0,2017-04-27 00:00:00,convertible_note,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/schoolze-convertible-note--4b9106a1,0.0,0,0.0,0,0.0

Rejected,Social Judo,http://socialjudo.com,parenting_tech_proj,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/locomotive-labs,United States,Massachusetts,Dartmouth,90807.0,Social Judo designs and develops parental control applications and games for teens and tweens that focus on smartphone safety.,"Parents whose teens and tweens use smartphones find themselves in a state of constant seige. Daily national news stories remind of us all of how kids are bombarded by bullying, profanity, nudity, sexting and more on their smartphones. The list of internet threats to teens and tweens only continues to grow. Instant access to Cyberspace via smartphones has dramatically changed parenting, and parents worry and wonder what they can do about these complex problems. In response to these threats, a couple of dads who saw their teens engulfed by their smartphones for hours every day said “enough is enough”. They set out to develop an app that is so technically advanced that it can lean forward into the swarm of new teen apps coming at kids at an ever-increasing accelerated pace on the internet. Social Judo was born, the app that uses the power of the internet against the power of the internet. This app shows what current content is on a child’s phone, analyzes it, and reports back to a parent if there is concerning content or even possibe danger. This new app uses artificial intelligence (AI) to Help Social Judo scour the internet and identify new dangers and threats. The AI component of Social Judo then brings that information back to the development team with ideas and suggestions on how to protect your kid from the dangers of these new apps without spying on them.  Dr. Matt Philips, a brain surgeon and visionary behind the development of this new app said; “I want to help establish the paradigm of parenting children in Cyberspace. We parent at home, we parent on the playing fields, we parent at school, but in the one space our kids spend 5-6 hours per day, goes unparented and virtually unsupervised. “It’s not your child that you need to be concerned about”, continues Philips. He notes it can be the other kids your child interfaces with daily. All it takes is one kid showing your child porn, or nudity, or explaining sex without love, and, once that has happened, you can’t take it back, you can’t un-see it. In most cases, you’re not even aware this has happened. Getting an alert sent to a parent’s phone that your child has been looking at or has been sent these kinds of messages or images is what Social Judo accomplishes, Dr. Philips calls it a “parenting moment”. From the parent’s app on a smartphone, they can lock a child’s phone, making it impossible to continue to be bullied or sent this kind of material. If you’re interested in talking about cyber bullying, the neuroscience behind smartphone addiction, teen suicide or “death by smartphone”, and a whole host of other subjects, then Dr. Philips, the new national expert on these subjects, would love to chat with you. Like himself, he wants other parents to be aware of the dangers of smartphone use and abuse that our children are being exposed to every day.

It is based on the long-term cross-media collaborative aspect that was developed during the early years of Dhaka Electronica Scene that has morphed into a robust resource sharing mechanism allowing all to do more. Since then, Akaliko has grown into its current identity as an independent record label and beyond with a DIY approach to sourcing new artists and helping other small record labels to grow their own identities. While electronic music is Akaliko’s primary focus, the initiative also collaborates with non-musicians, including writers, choreographers/dancers, communication specialists, and psychologists, to produce music, workshops, music videos, and sound art projects. DES formed in 2012 as a Facebook group with a handful of bedroom music producers mostly from Dhaka. The DIY community grew by leaps and bounds ever since by encouraging artist interaction and collaborative learning through both online and offline platforms. Curated by Khan Mohammad Faisal, DES successfully facilitated the collaborative community to eventually form new artist cliques, helped realize the potential to start new record labels for electronic music and also provided the talents for these creative ventures. Akaliko Records was founded in 2014 by artists Khan Mohammad Faisal and Vru Patel and joined by Shoummo Saha which brought in Kaaktalio in the mix, first as visual studio doing cinematography and photography and then live visuals and other forms of creative computing. DES held workshops for producers at different proficiency levels and partnered with various local and international organizations to help grow the practice of electronic music and sound art in Dhaka and Bangladesh through events and various music projects that include compilations, video projects, audio art installations, and hosted their flagship radio show at Colours FM 101.6 featuring the best works from the city on Monday nights. The struggle was never-ending in terms of outreach and getting the music heard. The limited time slots of FM radio stations was frustrating enough for the Akaliko team to then look on the digital solution of podcasting. Meanwhile, Akaliko Records was the first to surface as a netlabel and pave the way for more such formations and to take the success of DES community to the next level. Over time, it has developed the record label distribution, artist management aspect, music education programs, building a grassroots level ecosystem and delving into sound art. In recent times, the Akaliko family has grown to accommodate a much more diverse group of creative thinkers to make creative solutions and sometimes even force it.  Since 2014 Akaliko was in fiscal partnership with Rights and Sights for Children (a non-profit) as it developed and is currently pivoting as a private limited company in late 2018 to start its for-profit operations.  Akaliko is a member of ASEF 360 Culture, Samdani Artist-led Initiative, winner of BRAC Manthan Award and has been featured at Startup Dhaka.",175747.0,2018-11-10 00:00:00,seed,0.007307149381383377,0.01,0.0,1,https://www.crunchbase.com/funding_round/the-akaliko-company-seed--13767e28,0.0,0,0.03318288731532517,0,0.0

Each eduPad module covers one subject for one school year. eduPad apps typically gather between 1,500 and 6,000 exercises, creating by far the largest educational database on the Apple App Store. The exercises are stored on a local database on the device, resulting in an app that doesn't require an internet connection and can be used anywhere -- especially in class. This independent functionality eliminates concerns over network issues, one of teachers' most frequently cited and practiced reasons not to use IT technology in the classroom. Reference content is instead stored on cloud servers and synched with the apps on mobile devices in the background whenever an Internet connection is available, thus guaranteeing that the apps content is always up to date.  eduPad solution includes advanced game dynamics and links to social networks, making the apps attractive and engaging to children and students. Relationships between the student and his/her parents, teachers and/or tutors are securely managed through an internal messaging and notification system.  eduPad has released 20 apps for iPad under its iTooch brand, available now in the App Store.  eduPad is in discussion with scholastic publishers in Europe and the US.  eduPad apps are currently deployed for 5,000+ pupils and teachers in the 6th, 7th and 8th grade in Correze, France, the first region in France where local authorities agreed to equip its schools with iPads. eduPad is leveraging the grand-scale deployment as a living lab in order to improve the efficiency of its apps via unique and detailed feedback from teachers, pupils and parents.
